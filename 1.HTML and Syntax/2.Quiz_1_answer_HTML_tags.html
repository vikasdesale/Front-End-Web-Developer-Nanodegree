<body>Why does coding speed matter?
	<p>
Many people think that interviewers would challenge them with a couple of questions and if they provide the answer maybe with code, and then it was done. So it’s all about whether they can solve the problem or not.
People don’t realize the importance of coding speed until they fail several coding interviews in a row with very similar reason. People were pretty good at coming up with solutions, however, it could take them half an hour to complete the code. There are many people with the same frustration.
 </p>

<span>Normally, candidates will be asked one to two questions per interview (~45min) and most likely coding is required. In other words, we only have less than 20min per question (removing “trash time” in the beginning and end), which is more challenging than it seems to be.</span>
<span>In addition, a lot of people don’t even pay attention to coding speed. They don’t have the mindset that finishing the code in a short period of time is equally important as solving the problem itself. This is because if we don’t have enough time to code in an interview, it’s as bad as we fail to solve the problem.</span>
